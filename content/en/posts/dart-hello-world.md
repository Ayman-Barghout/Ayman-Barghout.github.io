#### Your First Dart Code
Let us start with the traditional “Hello World” example −

```dart:main.dart
main() { 
   print("Hello World!"); 
}
```

The `main()` function is a predefined method in Dart. This method acts as the entry point to the application. A Dart script needs the `main()` method for execution. print() is a predefined function that prints the specified string or value to the standard output i.e. the terminal.

The output of the above code will be −
`Hello World!`
